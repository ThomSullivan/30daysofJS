# 30 Days of JavaScript

## This is work done while completing the [30 days of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript) challenge created by [Asabeneh Yeatyeh](https://github.com/Asabeneh). 

At the start of this challenge I was only slightly familiar with JavaScript. The reason I decided to take on this challenge was to increase my abilities with the language. The challenge starts with fundamental ideas like data types, loop structures, and object oriented programming before diving into DOM manipulation. Over the thirty day challenge thousands of lines of code were to be written to complete the daily exercises related to each dayâ€™s instruction. These exercises began as simple challenges and end with creating interactive web pages, mostly based on a large country data file, with only an animation for reference. 

After completing the thirty days of challenges, I feel much more comfortable and confident working with JavaScript. I feel confident that I can now create web pages that can do nearly anything that I could dream up. This is exactly what the final days of the challenge entail, creating a page with only pictures to guide you. Putting into action all the concepts learned about through the challenge to recreate these pictures makes these last days are the biggest confidence builders. The level of  understanding of how all these concepts come together to create interactive web pages I gained through this challenge is astounding. 

I would highly recommend taking on this challenge to anyone who has a desire to learn more about JavaScript.  A beginner in the world of coding can pick up and complete this challenge, and a veteran is bound to learn a thing of two.  

anyways.... off to tackle [30 Days of React](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-React)!
